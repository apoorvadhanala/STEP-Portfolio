    <p>Hi! My name is Apoorva Dhanala and I am a rising junior at the University of Georgia studying Computer Science 
      with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence. At UGA, I am founder and president of UGA’s chapter of Girls Who Code 
      where we work with local, underprivileged Athens-Clarke County schools where UGA students volunteer weekly hoping to 
      expose students to coding while closing the gender gap in technology. I am also involved with the Georgia Recruitment 
      Team where I represent the admissions office as an ambassador at panels and tours, Athens Prison Tutorial where I tutor 
      prison inmates at the Athens-Clarke County Jail who lack their high school diplomas and help them improve their skills 
      in order to pass their GED examination, and with the Honors Program Student Council where I work to help bring academic 
      and social opportunities to students in the Honors Program. Outside of classes and club involvement, I am a CURO Honors 
      Research scholar where I have been involved with Linguistics and Natural Language Processing research and most recently, 
      Android App development work.

    I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia and have a little sister. I have learned piano and the classical Indian dance 
      form, Kuchipudi, since I was 5 years old; the skills I have learnt from these art forms, from patience and perseverance 
      to responsibility and delicateness, are a big part of who I am today. Some of my favorite things to do are travel, take 
      pictures, cook, and watch TV. I love traveling to new places and getting to see different parts of the world and I also 
      love photography and taking pictures whether they are travel pictures or senior pictures. As for cooking and baking, some
      of my favorite things to experiment with are different types of pasta & sauces and also chocolate chip cookies! Whenever 
      I watch TV, some of my go-to’s are Suits, Modern Family or Scandal.
